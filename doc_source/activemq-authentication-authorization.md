# Messaging Authentication and Authorization for ActiveMQ<a name="activemq-authentication-authorization"></a>

You can access your brokers using the following protocols with TLS enabled:
+ [AMQP](http://activemq.apache.org/amqp.html)
+ [MQTT](http://activemq.apache.org/mqtt.html)
+ MQTT over [WebSocket](http://activemq.apache.org/websockets.html)
+ [OpenWire](http://activemq.apache.org/openwire.html)
+ [STOMP](http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html)
+ STOMP over WebSocket

Amazon MQ uses native ActiveMQ authentication to manage user permissions\. For information about restrictions related to ActiveMQ usernames and passwords, see [Users](amazon-mq-limits.md#activemq-user-limits)\.

To authorize ActiveMQ users and groups to works with queues and topics, you must [edit your broker's configuration](amazon-mq-editing-managing-configurations.md)\. Amazon MQ uses ActiveMQ's [Simple Authentication Plugin](http://activemq.apache.org/security.html#Security-SimpleAuthenticationPlugin) to restrict reading and writing to destinations\. For more information and examples, see [Always Configure an Authorization Map](using-amazon-mq-securely.md#always-configure-authorization-map) and `[authorizationEntry](child-element-details.md#authorizationEntry)`\.

**Note**  
Currently, Amazon MQ doesn't support Client Certificate Authentication or plugins for Java Authentication and Authorization Service \(JAAS\)\.
