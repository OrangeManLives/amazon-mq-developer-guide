# Configuring Amazon MQ to publish logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs<a name="security-logging-monitoring-configure-cloudwatch"></a>

Amazon MQ is integrated with Amazon CloudWatch Logs, a service that monitors, stores, and accesses your log files from a variety of sources\. For example, you can [configure CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) to receive notifications of [broker reboots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/api-reference/rest-api-broker-reboot.html) or troubleshoot [ActiveMQ broker configuration](amazon-mq-broker-configuration-parameters.md) errors\. For more information about CloudWatch Logs, see the *[Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/)*
