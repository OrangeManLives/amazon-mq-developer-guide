# How Amazon MQ works<a name="amazon-mq-how-it-works"></a>

Amazon MQ makes it easy to create a message broker with the computing and storage resources that fit your needs\. You can create, manage, and delete brokers using the AWS Management Console, Amazon MQ REST API, or the AWS Command Line Interface\.

This section describes the basic elements of a message broker for ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ engine types, lists available Amazon MQ broker instance types and their statuses, and provides an overview of broker architecture and configuration options\.

To learn about Amazon MQ REST APIs, see the *[Amazon MQ REST API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/api-reference/)*\.
