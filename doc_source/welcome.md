# What is Amazon MQ?<a name="welcome"></a>

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that makes it easy to migrate to a message broker in the cloud\. A *message broker* allows software applications and components to communicate using various programming languages, operating systems, and formal messaging protocols\. Currently, Amazon MQ supports [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) engine types\.

Amazon MQ works with your existing applications and services without the need to manage, operate, or maintain your own messaging system\.

## How is Amazon MQ different from Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS?<a name="difference-from-sqs-sns"></a>

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that provides compatibility with many popular message brokers\. We recommend Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing message brokers that rely on compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP 0\-9\-1, AMQP 1\.0, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP\.

[Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) are queue and topic services that are highly scalable, simple to use, and don't require you to set up message brokers\. We recommend these services for new applications that can benefit from nearly unlimited scalability and simple APIs\.
